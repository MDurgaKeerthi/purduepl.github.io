My research interests are in compilers and computer architecture with an emphasis on performance, reliability, and security. I have developed program analysis and microarchitecture optimization techniques for soft error resilience, concurrency bug detection, and system security such as memory safety and Linux kernel permission check. Currently, I am working on energy-efficient intermittent computation and nonvolatile memory crash consistency. To come up with cost-effective solutions, I often leverage compiler-architecture codesign and repurpose existing hardware features.
