I lead the Duality Lab. We study the engineering of software-intensive computing systems, writ broad. Our primary interests are in safety (e.g. correct and usable) and security, achieved in part through effective engineering processes. We apply a “dual” socio-technical philosophy — high-quality systems must be engineered using both human and technical perspectives. We are empiricists; we strive to measure the practical impact of problems and solutions.
